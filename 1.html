<h2>HTML</h2>
<P><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specificatrion">The HyperText
        Markup Language or HTML</a> is the <strong>standard markup <u>language</u></strong> for documents designed to
be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web
pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
document.<img src="coding.jpg" width="75%"></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:50px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
    objects such as
    interactive
forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are
delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the
page. Other tags su>ch as surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as
    sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
